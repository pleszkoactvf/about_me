			<h3><center>Biography</center></h3>

			<p>I was born on Staten Island (nobody's perfect) on September 22nd, 2001 at 4:44 A.M. My parents are both of direct Polish decent. My mother was born in Poland and my father was born here in New York City, but his parents were both born in Poland. I went to a Catholic School called Saint Peter's for kindergarden while I lived on Staten Island. Then I moved to Greenpoint, Brooklyn in 2007, and went to a Catholic middle school called Saint Stan's until 8th grade. I got into ACTvF in 2015, and I am graduating in 2019. I have taken multiple film internships during my 4 years at TvF, which has helped me learn about working in the industry.</p>


			<h3><center>Technology</center></h3>

			<p>Most technology that I use on a daily basis involves my phone, computers, trains, air conditioning, and the internet. Most of these pieces of technology are very important in my life, because most people in present day Western civilization use phones to communicate and navigate, trains to get to school or work and back, air conditioning to keep me comfortable and last but not least, the internet for taking up most of my free time. Almost every piece of technology in my life has a purpose, and they do help me get through the mundaneness and struggles of life.</p>

			<h3><center>Two truths and a lie</center></h3>
